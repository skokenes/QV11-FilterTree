#QV11- FilterTree

This code demonstrates how to create a scrollable, expandable list of filters in QlikView 11 without any extensions. This functionality allows you to include many filters in a small space on the page, with ease of use for users. It is built mobile-first, so it works well for iPad apps.
The GitHub repository includes implementation instructions, a qvs file with the necessary subroutine, and an example implementation.
