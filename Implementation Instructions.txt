1) Create a field that contains the list of filter dimensions

2) Call the genFilterTree subroutine to generate the necessary data and variables
	a. The genFilterTree() sub takes two inputs: the name of the field containing the list of filters, and a name for the tree filter which will be used as a prefix and suffix when naming fields and variables

3) Create the pivot table
	a. the easiest way to do this is to copy the object from the example file and just update all of the references to reference your fields and variables. For example, the dimension _Filter.Node would become <YOUR TREE NAME>.Node
	b. the items to change are:
		- the 2 dimensions
		- the expression
		- the background colors for all dimensions and expressions


4) Add the Toggle field action on <YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeToggle
	Action 1: Set Variable
		Variable:	='vToggle.<YOUR TREE NAME>.$(=<YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeToggleNo)'
		Value: 		=not(vToggle.<YOUR TREE NAME>.$(=<YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeToggleNo))
	Action 2: Clear Field
		Field: 		<YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeToggle

5) Add the field selection action on <YOUR TREE NAME>.Node
	Action 1: Toggle Select
		Field:		=<YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeParent
		Value:		=<YOUR TREE NAME>.NodeValue
	Action 2: Clear Field
		Field:		<YOUR TREE NAME>.Node
